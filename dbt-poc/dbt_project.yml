## full docs https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configuring-models

## in this example, we tell dbt to build all models in the `example/` dir as tables
## These settings can be overridden in the individual model files using the
## `{{ config(...) }}` macro
models:
  dbt_poc:
    # config indicated by + and applies to all files under `models/example`
    example:
